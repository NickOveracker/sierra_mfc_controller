# Python Controller for Sierra Instruments Mass Flow Controller

This code allows a user to control a Sierra Instruments SmartTrak Series 100 Mass Flow Controller from any computer capable of serial connections and python. Tested environments are Windows 7 and OSX 10.12.6.  

The manual for this device can be [viewed here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8ZE8AuY2VhrMjBSQXVhYV8yQjg/view?usp=sharing) and a current listing for this product can be [accessed here](http://www.sierrainstruments.com/products/c100.html) though no promises Sierra won't change that link. This controller has worked for the SmartTrak 2 as well as the 100 but has not been tested as extensively on the 2.   

If you're interested in adding more commands to this project feel free to fork the code and customize as you like.
